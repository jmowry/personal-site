          <p class="lead">Though I wouldn't necessarily call myself, an "outdoorsy" person, I do enjoy a good hike when the weather cooperates. Sometimes, getting away from the screen is an absolute need, and taking a drive through the Black Hills is also pretty fun. And to be honest, if it's nice outside, just about anything can be a good time. </p>

          <p class="lead">On the more active side, I also get a good amount of use out of my bicycle. Once again, weather permitting, I find riding my bike to school to be one of the most stress-relieving, life-threatening adventures I could think to tackle at 8:00AM (we don't have a ton of precautions for bicyclists in Rapid City).</p>

          <p class="lead">I'm an avid American football fan and take fantasy football almost as seriously as I do the actual sport. My father is from Rhode Island, so naturally, I was born into watching the Patriots. Fortunately, I happen to live in what might be their "golden-era", and for that, I'm grateful to get to support such a successful team of awesome players, and gladly take the flak that comes with being a Pats fan.</p>

          <p class="lead"> Though I don't play any "sports" myself, I do get a round or two of disc golf in when I can; if I can make bogey on each hole, I typically call that a win. On occasion, I even find myself able to make it to Spearfish to play one of their more challenging courses if I'm really trying to remind myself why I will never be a pro.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Brewing </h2>
          <p class="lead"> I appreciate a good beer as much as the next guy. Maybe a little more than the next guy. With that in mind, I've always been fascinated by the process of creating a beer that I could share with friends and family, and decided to take up brewing over spring break in March 2016. My first brew, a Canadian Ale (yes, really), is nearing the end of the fermentation phase. If everything goes according to schedule, bottling should begin in the last week of March and my beer, for better or for worse, shall be ready to consume responsibly in early April. </p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Music<span class="text-muted"> and <em>trying</em> to play it</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">I must admit, one of the larger factors when choosing my roommates, was that one of them was a great guitarist. Between him, a few other friends, and myself on drums, making loud noises is somewhat of a past-time for us. We like to try our hand at anything from Zach Brown Band to Metallica to Phil Collins, and we misguidedly believe we have the skill to back it up some days. Though I have never had any formal music training or experience, I seem to have a natural knack for rhythm (thanks RockBand) and have molded my interest into a semi-passable skill and full-fledged hobby. When school is pouring down hellfire upon us, sometimes a good old-fashioned jam session is just right to alleviate stress. Beer helps. Kind of. Well, it's fun.</p>
