        <p class="lead blog-post-title">How I Got Started</p>
            <p class="blog-post-meta"><em>a brief-ish introduction</em> </p>

          <p class="lead">More or less on a whim, I settled on the in-town college of South Dakota School of Mines & Technology out of highschool. So given that I had never really been challenged at Central Highschool (nor gave it the effort), it was no shock that SDSM&T was a shock to the system. After ramping up to "everyone else" and actually kicking my butt into gear, I grew to really love what I studied and, to many professors' surprise, take my education extremely seriously. </p>

          <p class="lead">Our curriculum at SDSM&T has a heavy C/C++ focus that, I feel, gives us a very good foundation in low-level programming and really understanding how things work "under the hood". Doing the tedious C programming early on really acclimated me to think with efficiency in mind, when most people might shrug it off as "the compiler's job" or something to that effect. </p>

          <p class="lead">Somewhere around the end of my sophomore year, I began really branching out and getting more acquainted with "pure OOP" languages like Java and C#. I started developing MVC desktop applications using out-of-the-box template programs in Visual Studio in my first internship with Emit Technologies. This really got my feet wet in the business world and showed me that there was a bit more to software engineering than managing my own memory and constructing my own low-level data structures.</p>

          <p class="lead">From there, I began taking an interest in mobile development and used my Software Engineering class as a springboard into, with some good friends and classmates, pulling together and writing a business plan for a theoretical Android application. We went on to win an award in our department,  dubbed "The Butterfield Cup", and decided to attend local business accelerators and entrepreneurship conventions to become familiar with business, marketing, intellectual property rights, and so much more that is only on the horizons of most developers' focus.</p>

          <p class="lead">Today, Crowd Control has blossomed into a cross-platform (iOS/Androic) application with five collaborators including myself. We started development on the project at the beginning of the Fall 2015 semester, for our Senior Design classes. We have taken part of a couple noteworthy competitions (more information?) in an effort to better establish ourselves as a startup software company in the Black Hills, and to take Crowd Control as far as we can. </p>

          <p class="lead">With all this, I feel that my unique business-oriented perspective has given me an edge over my fellow developers. I have been trained to be able to see the "big picture" when developing software, and as a result of all the exposure we have received through Crowd Control, gained a lot of experience in communicating with others. Not to mention getting <em>very</em> familiar with Java.</p>

          <p class="lead"> Our "flagship" mobile application, written and owned fully by Bowtaps, LLC, is group management application that helps users find other users in their groups of friends. Crowd Control features group messaging, group management, and GPS locations for its users. The idea, somewhat jokingly, spawned more or less out of necessity; everybody has that friend who you just can't seem to track down when you go out on town.</p>

          <p class="lead">A fairly rudimentary exercise in building a desktop GUI application in Java. This project simply outlined that we design and implement an interface to view various weather data, represented by XML files. The data provided was quite large, as the data was acquired every 15 minutes for a few years. We were tasked with parsing those XML files and displaying the information via graphs and various statistics. In the end, though there were some bugs with out implementation, it gave us a very good crash course to desktop GUIs using Java Swing and the JFreeChart package.</p>
